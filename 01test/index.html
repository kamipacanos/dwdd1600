    <h2>What are the rules for AI Generated Content?</h2>
    <p>AI-generated content rules usually depend on your teacher or school, but in general you should only use AI if it's allowed and you should never turn in AI work as if it's completely your own. AI is usually okay for helping you learn, like explaining concepts, brainstorming ideas, or checking grammar, but it's often not allowed to write full assignments, answer quizzes, or generate work you're supposed to create yourself. If your instructor requires it, you should also disclose or cite your AI use, and always double-check the information because you are responsible for anything you submit.</p>
