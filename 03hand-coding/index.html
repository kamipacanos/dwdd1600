        <h2>How to Plan Your Japan Vacation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Choose Your Trip</strong>
                <p>Decide how many days you have, the best season to visit, and what region you want to explore. This
                    helps you build a realistic plan that fits your time.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Set Your Budget</strong>
                <p>Choose how much you want to spend overall. Setting a budget early helps you avoid overspending and
                    makes booking easier.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Book the Essentials</strong>
                <p>Book your flights and hotels. These are the most important reservations and will lock in your
                    schedule and where you'll stay.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Get Ready to Go</strong>
                <p>Plan how you'll get around once there. Then make a packing list so you're ready. This step makes your
                    trip smoother and helps you feel confident before you leave.</p>
